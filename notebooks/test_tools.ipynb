      "Inception Labs AI, a Palo Alto–based company pioneering diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), has raised $50 million in fresh funding. The round was led by [Menlo Ventures](https://techfundingnews.com/us-vc-firm-menlo-ventures-closes-1-35b-fund-to-invest-in-ai-startups/), with participation from [Mayfield](https://techfundingnews.com/uber-alums-teambridge-secures-28m-to-manage-the-hourly-workforce/), Innovation Endeavors, [NVentures](https://techfundingnews.com/san-franciscos-exa-raises-85m-at-700m-valuation-to-build-the-search-engine-for-ai/) – NVIDIA’s venture arm, Microsoft’s [M12](https://techfundingnews.com/female-founded-enterprise-tech-startup-deployed-rolls-4m-to-transform-the-language-of-project-planning-and-work-agreements/), [Snowflake Ventures](https://techfundingnews.com/snowflake-invests-in-115m-funding-round-of-observe-a-data-observability-startup/), and Databricks Investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The funding will accelerate product development, expand research teams, and enhance real-time AI capabilities across text, voice, and code.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **The challenges it tackles**\n",
      "\n",
      "Most large language models today rely on autoregression, a method that generates words one at a time. While accurate, this sequential process is painfully slow and costly, making it difficult for enterprises to scale or deliver seamless real-time experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inception takes a radically different approach. Its diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) borrow principles from image and video generation technologies such as DALL·E, Midjourney, and Sora. Instead of crafting text word by word, dLLMs generate entire responses in parallel. This innovation delivers outputs that are 10x faster and far more efficient, without sacrificing coherence or accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Mercury: Speed meets intelligence**\n",
      "\n",
      "Inception’s flagship model, Mercury, is the world’s first commercially available diffusion LLM. It outpaces even speed-optimised models from [OpenAI](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-strikes-38b-deal-with-amazon-for-ai-cloud-services/), [Anthropic](https://techfundingnews.com/anthropic-10-billion-funding-openai-rival/), and Google by 5–10x, while matching their precision. Mercury comes in two versions: a general-purpose model for conversational tasks and Mercury Coder, tuned for code generation. Both feature a 128,000-token context window, equivalent to about 300 pages of text, allowing for deep and complex interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "By drastically cutting GPU requirements, Inception enables organisations to run larger models at the same cost or serve more users using existing infrastructure. This makes Mercury ideal for latency-sensitive applications such as live voice assistants, dynamic UIs, and real-time programming tools, areas where speed defines usability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Inventors of a new language era**\n",
      "\n",
      "Inception Labs AI was co-founded by [Stefano Ermon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ermon), [Aditya Grover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-grover), and [Volodymyr Kuleshov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/volodymyr-kuleshov-6aa83294) in 2024 in Palo Alto, California. The founding trio, who have roots at Stanford, UCLA, and Cornell, were among the early researchers behind core AI advances such as diffusion, flash attention, and direct preference optimisation. CEO Stefano Ermon is also a co-inventor of the diffusion techniques that power systems like Midjourney and [OpenAI’s Sora](https://techfundingnews.com/openais-sora-on-the-rise-inside-sam-altmans-7-trillion-ai-investment-quest/).\n",

       "   'summary': \"Diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional autoregressive LLMs, offering significant potential for improved runtime efficiency. However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point improvement over unconstrained inference\",\n",

The phases form heuristically from LaIn3 by replacing every (n+1)th (100) mixed plane of La and In atoms with a plane of Co-atoms. For the n=1 phase, LaCoIn5, jump frequencies were too small to detect. Two signals were observed, one for indium atoms next to the Co-planes and the other for more distant indium atoms. No relaxation was observed for atoms next to the Co-planes, indicating that there is no diffusion across the Co-planes. With increasing n, jump rates for the other In-atoms increased toward values observed for LaIn3. Jump frequency activation enthalpies for n= 3 and 5 were observed to be the same as for n=\\\\infty, suggesting the same diffusion mechanism. However, the jump-frequency prefactors were found to be smaller for small n, which is attributed to reductions in the connectivity of the diffusion sublattice.

       "   'summary': 'Text-conditioned diffusion models have emerged as a promising tool for neural video generation. However, current models still struggle with intricate spatiotemporal prompts and often generate restricted or incorrect motion. To address these limitations, we introduce LLM-grounded Video Diffusion (LVD). Instead of directly generating videos from the text inputs, LVD first leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate dynamic scene layouts based on the text inputs and subsequently uses the generated layouts to guide a diffusion model for video generation. We show that LLMs are able to understand complex spatiotemporal dynamics from text alone and generate layouts that align closely with both the prompts and the object motion patterns typically observed in the real world. We then propose to guide video diffusion models with these layouts by adjusting the attention maps. Our approach is training-free and can be integrated into any video diffusion model that admits classifier guidance. Our results demonstrate that LVD significantly outperforms its base video diffusion model and several strong baseline methods in faithfully generating videos with the desired attributes and motion patterns.',\n",

Using perturbed angular correlation of gamma rays (PAC), jumps of probe atoms cause nuclear quadrupole relaxation that can be fitted to obtain the mean jump frequency. An overview is given of the application of this approach to highly ordered intermetallic compounds having the L12 (Cu3Au) crystal structure. New results are then presented for jump frequencies of 111In/Cd probe atoms in pseudo-binary L12 compounds of the forms In3(La1-xPrx) and (In1-xSnx)3La. For the mixed rare-earth system, jump frequencies are found to scale with composition between jump frequencies of the end-member phases In3La and In3Pr. However, for the mixed sp-element system, a large decrease in jump frequency is observed as Sn atoms substitute for In-atoms. This difference in behavior appears to depend on whether atomic disorder is on the diffusion sublattice (In-Sn substitution), as opposed to a neighboring sublattice (La-Pr substitution), whether or not there is a difference in diffusion mechanism between end-member phases, and/or whether or not there is a valence difference between the mixing atoms.

       "   'summary': 'Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in many domains, they still have a tendency to hallucinate and generate fictitious responses to user requests. This problem can be alleviated by augmenting LLMs with information retrieval (IR) systems (also known as retrieval-augmented LLMs). Applying this strategy, LLMs can generate more factual texts in response to user input according to the relevant content retrieved by IR systems from external corpora as references. In addition, by incorporating external knowledge, retrieval-augmented LLMs can answer in-domain questions that cannot be answered by solely relying on the world knowledge stored in parameters. To support research in this area and facilitate the development of retrieval-augmented LLM systems, we develop RETA-LLM, a {RET}reival-{A}ugmented LLM toolkit. In RETA-LLM, we create a complete pipeline to help researchers and users build their customized in-domain LLM-based systems. Compared with previous retrieval-augmented LLM systems, RETA-LLM provides more plug-and-play modules to support better interaction between IR systems and LLMs, including {request rewriting, document retrieval, passage extraction, answer generation, and fact checking} modules.

       "   'summary': 'Anomalous diffusion has been investigated in many systems. Pulsed field gradient (PFG) anomalous diffusion is much more complicated than PFG normal diffusion. There have been many theoretical and experimental studies for PFG isotropic anomalous diffusion, but there are very few theoretical treatments reported for anisotropic anomalous diffusion. Currently, there is not a general PFG signal attenuation expression, which includes the finite gradient pulse effect and can treat all three types of anisotropic fractional diffusions: general fractional diffusion, time fractional diffusion, and space-fractional diffusion. In this paper, the recently developed instantaneous signal attenuation (ISA) method was applied to obtain PFG signal attenuation expression for free and restricted anisotropic anomalous diffusion with two models: fractal derivative and fractional derivative models. The obtained PFG signal attenuation expression for anisotropic anomalous diffusion can reduce to the reported result for PFG anisotropic normal diffusion. The results can also reduce to reported PFG isotropic anomalous diffusion results obtained by effective phase shift diffusion equation method and instantaneous signal attenuation method. For anisotropic space-fractional diffusion, the obtained result agrees with that obtained by the modified Bloch equation method. Additionally, The PFG signal attenuation expressions for free and restricted anisotropic curvilinear diffusions were derived by the traditional method, the results of which agree with the PFG anisotropic fractional diffusion results based on the fractional derivative model. The powder pattern of PFG anisotropic diffusion was also discussed. The results here improve our understanding of PFG anomalous diffusion, and provide new formalisms for PFG anisotropic anomalous diffusion in NMR and MRI.',\n",

However, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged, due to LLM judges' biases and inconsistent decision-making. Previous research has developed evaluation frameworks to assess reliability of LLM judges and their alignment with human preferences. However, the employed evaluation metrics often lack adequate explainability and fail to address LLM internal inconsistency. Additionally, existing studies inadequately explore the impact of various prompt templates when applying LLM-as-a-Judge methods, leading to potentially inconsistent comparisons between different alignment algorithms. In this work, we systematically evaluate LLM-as-a-Judge on alignment tasks by defining more theoretically interpretable evaluation metrics and explicitly mitigating LLM internal inconsistency from reliability metrics. We develop an open-source framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability and alignment of LLM judges, which facilitates practitioners to choose LLM judges for alignment tasks. In the experiments, we examine effects of diverse prompt templates on LLM-judge reliability and also demonstrate our developed framework by comparing various LLM judges on two common alignment datasets (i.e., TL;DR Summarization and HH-RLHF-Helpfulness). Our results indicate a significant impact of prompt templates on LLM judge performance, as well as a mediocre alignment level between the tested LLM judges and human evaluators.\",\n",

With constant innovation in LLM serving optimizations and model architecture evolving at breakneck speed, the hardware requirements to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs) remain an open research question.\\n  To answer the question, we present an analytical tool, GenZ, to efficiently navigate the relationship between diverse LLM model architectures(Dense, GQA, MoE, Mamba), LLM serving optimizations(Chunking, Speculative decoding, quanitization), and AI platform design parameters. Our tool estimates LLM inference performance metrics for the given scenario. We have validated against real hardware platforms running various different LLM models, achieving a max geomean error of 5.82.We use GenZ to identify compute, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, network latency, and network bandwidth requirements across diverse LLM inference use cases. We also study diverse architectural choices in use today (inspired by LLM serving platforms from several vendors) to help inform computer architects designing next-generation AI hardware accelerators and platforms. The trends and insights derived from GenZ can guide AI engineers deploying LLMs as well as computer architects designing next-generation hardware accelerators and platforms.

While hallucinations-unintentional falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal optimization.
